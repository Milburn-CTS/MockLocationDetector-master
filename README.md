# MockLocationDetector
An android library to help detect mock locations

# Gradle
Add the next dependency to your _gradle.build_

    compile 'com.inforoeste.mocklocationdetector:mock-location-detector:1.0.0'

# Usage
From anywhere on your code just call the class MockLocationDetector to access the following available static methods

1. `isLocationFromMockProvider`
2. `checkForAllowMockLocationsApps`
3. `isAllowMockLocationsOn`

To detect if the location object you received is a mock just call the method `isLocationFromMockProvider` and pass
the context and the location object. This method only works on API 18+ if this method is called on lower apis it then
it will check if Allow Mock Locations is ON or not and return the result. This is the recomended method for most cases.

If you want to check if there are apps on the users phone that have "ALLOW_MOCK_LOCATIONS" permission on their
manifest just call `checkForAllowMockLocationsApps`. This method is usefull for apps that use root access to enable/disable
allow mock locations at runtime to try to fool other apps on lower apis (API 17 or lower). Also starting on Marshmallow its
no longer possible to enable/disable allow mock locations at runtime with root permissions.

Finally you can call `isAllowMockLocationsOn` to check if the system setting Allow Mock Locations is enabled or not. Be aware
that this method is deprecated and doesnt work on Marshmallow or up. If you call this method on API 23+ it will always return
false.
